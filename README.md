# rmarc
A Ruby library to work with MARC and MARCXML bibliographic records based on an iterative parser. The library provides readers and writers for MARC records in ISO 2709 format and in MARCXML format. This code was imported from the Ruby gem as the source code was no longer available with the end of life of RubyForge. The code was written in 2005 and is not actively maintained at the moment. The RubyGems.org page is here: https://rubygems.org/gems/rmarc/versions/0.2.0
